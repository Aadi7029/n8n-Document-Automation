For this you would need the n8n Self Hosted Starter kit or else the n8n cloud service access.
The kit is free to downlaod and for setting it up you either need Docker Desktop to host it or you can use
render and supabase as its database.
You can download the self hosted starter kit from the github repo " https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit " and clone the repo.
You can learn more about how to host this at "https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/"
